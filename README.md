## Problem Statement:

```
CONio.h Round 2

Rakesh, an aspiring Civil Engineer wanted to analyze the Bending moment and
Shear force of all the different types of Beams. He was always curious about the
application of using a programming language to analyze these beams, so he
approached his friend Thatvesh who was well-versed in coding. They both decided
to write a code together by combining their knowledge.
Imagine yourself to be in place of Rakesh and Thatvesh, you and your teammates
are expected to come up with a code which will analyze the Shear and Bending
Moment of different types of beams (Simply supported beams and Cantilever
Beams) subjected to different types of loads (Point load and uniformly distributed
loads).
Guidelines
1. The program should have a good and understandable script
2. You have to write a single code for both the beams and load types.
(Note: More emphasis on the complexity of the type of beam and
number of loads selected)
3. The valuator should have control over the input data and it should
not be predetermined.
4. The Values for the length of the beam, the loads applied, distances
of the loads from support reactions should all be input data which
the Valuator can vary.
5. The operations performed should be explained in the code using
the required operator (Example: Using # to explain the below code
in case of Python).
6. The solutions should be correct.
7. Graphs, Diagrams etc are not mandatory, but addition of such will
fetch better results.
